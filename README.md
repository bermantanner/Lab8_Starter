Graceful degradation/Service workers:
Graceful degradation means to build a full featured app using advanced technologies and then going back and making sure it is functional on older platforms. Service workers are like this because htey enhance modern web apps with stuff like offline support, background caching, faster load times, but it does not break the core functionality if service workers arent supported on a specific browser, the app will still work just without the extra benefits I just listed.
